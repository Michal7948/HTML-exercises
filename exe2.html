      <b>What is HTML:</b> HTML, which stands for Hypertext Markup Language, is
      the foundation of web development. It's a markup language used to create
      the structure and content of web pages. HTML uses a system of elements and
      tags to define how information on a webpage should be displayed, such as
      headings, paragraphs, links, and images.

      <b>Structure of HTML:</b> HTML documents are organized in a hierarchical
      structure. They begin with an &lt;html&gt; element, followed by a
      &lt;head&gt; section for metadata like page title and links to
      stylesheets, and a &lt;body&gt; section for the visible content. HTML
      elements are enclosed in tags, which consist of an opening tag, content,
      and a closing tag. For example, a basic paragraph is created with
      &lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt; tags.

      <b>Semantic HTML:</b> Semantic HTML is a concept that encourages the use
      of specific HTML elements to describe the content's meaning. Elements like
      &lt;header&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;main&gt;, and &lt;footer&gt; help both
      browsers and assistive technologies understand the structure of a webpage,
      improving accessibility and search engine optimization.

      <b>Attributes and Links:</b> HTML elements can have attributes that
      provide additional information about the element. For instance, the
      &lt;a&gt; element is used to create hyperlinks, and it includes an href
      attribute to specify the URL the link should point to. Attributes are key
      to adding interactivity and functionality to web pages.

      <b> HTML and CSS:</b> HTML is responsible for the structure and content of
      a webpage, while Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are used to control its
      presentation and layout. By combining HTML and CSS, web developers can
      create visually appealing and responsive designs that work across various
      devices and screen sizes.
