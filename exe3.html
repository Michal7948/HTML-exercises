          Shmuel, musician, creator and music producer "Points" is written about
          the situations in which there is a feeling that we are not appreciated
          enough, that they even try to put us down, there is no "mood", it is
          difficult to rise up and have a happy life. This is exactly the moment
          to look inside ourselves for the good points that we have that can
          give us the strength to be excited about life and reevaluate it. I
          hope that 'Points' will give people this reminder - there is a lot of
          light and goodness in you."

          Zurit. The timing of the publication of this song was postponed due to
          the virus, difficult days for the world and especially for music
          people.
